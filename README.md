This game is in creation. The basic idea of this it is to create a clone 
of Assassins Creed Unity, but with small differences. It's written in Java and 
the design is created in Blender. 

There're some code snippets from monkeyzone in it, because i'll need them for 
an framework example. Currently the login, loading screen, game gui and the beginning
of the game are partly finished. The main classes are not connected yet, so you must start
the game individual. 

If you have some ideas or you want to be a part of our team you can send me an email:

The team consits of one programmer and one designer for the logos and blender models.
